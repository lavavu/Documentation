points module
=============

Warning! EXPERIMENTAL:
 these features and functions are under development, will have bugs,
 and may be heavily modified in the future

Tools for importing and working with point clouds
- OBJ loader, requires pywavefront
- PLY loader, requires plyfile
- LAS loader, requires laspy

These functions ported from my viz script repo here:
https://github.com/mivp/vizscripts/tree/master/pointcloud
More tools can be found there, including a ptx reader which handles transformations of multiple point clouds into one coord space
